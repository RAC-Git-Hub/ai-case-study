# TITLE

An Effective Altruist's mega-billion dollar roll-of-the-dice effort to protect humanity from AI

## Overview and Origin

An Effective Altruist focuses on finding better ways to help humanity and put into action the steps necessary to do just that. In the context of AI, which is a rapidly developing field, there appears to be no limit on what AI can do - it is just a matter of time. AI is being applied to all forms of everyday life activities. The goal is to train AI to develop at human level at which point technology will dramatically accelerate. (What Is Effective Altruism? | Effective Altruism, n.d.).  And with that lies the potential for great risks. Just as what was seen with the rapid development of the nuclear bomb, its uses, and its dire results, so too could AI produce some deleterious effects upon humanity, if not flat-out annihilation. The reason humans are in charge of the world and not some other animal is purely a matter of intelligence. But what if AI creates something more intelligent than us? Would AI be used by some entity to control the world? How could we control something that is smarter than us? (Todd, 2023). The good news is that there are various groups that realize the inherent dangers in advancing society through technology and have the impetus to combat such maligned consequences. But one of the big problems of acting on this is that it takes massive amounts of money to make this happen on the order of billions of dollars and beyond. One particular group of people decided it was their desire and duty to face this issue head-on. They chose to leave very secure positions of leadership in the growing AI community to establish a company for the common good. That company is Anthropic, PBC.

* Name of company

The name of the company of interest is Anthropic, PBC. Anthropic, PBC is a private company. There are limitations to researching private companies since much of their data is not publicly disclosed. Therefore, the information following is derived from various resources, but at times may only reflect partial sets of facts and information.

Anthropic formed their corporation as a PBC, a Public Benefit Corporation, in hopes of making profits while doing public good
>"The PBC form allows the company’s board of directors to simultaneously pursue the pecuniary interests of stockholders along with the best interests of those materially affected by the company’s conduct and the specific public benefit mission stated in Anthropic’s certificate of incorporation, which is to “responsibly develop and maintain advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity.”"(Anthropic Long-Term Benefit Trust, 2023)

* When was the company incorporated?

Anthropic, PBC was incorporated in the year 2021. One source lists the specific date as February 3, 2021 (Anthropic, Inc., n.d.). Another source lists the founding date as January 26, 2021 (Anthropic PBC - Company Profile and News, n.d.). However, the sources explored all seem to agree with a year of incorporation as 2021.


* Who are the founders of the company?

The main founders of Anthropic, PBC are Dario Amodei (Co-Founder and CEO) and his sibling Daniela Amodei (Co-Founder & President) (Broadway, 2023). Other founders include Jack Clark (Co-Founder), Jared Kaplan (Co-Founder), Sam McCandish (Co-Founder) and Tom Brown (Co-Founder) (ANTHROPIC Profile, n.d.). Although there are six founders listed here, one resource states that there are 11 original members (Moss, 2023). However, during a podcast with Daniela and Dario Amodeo published on March, 4, 2022, Daniela states that there are 7 original members (Daniela and Dario Amodei on Anthropic - Future of Life Institute, 2022).  

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Several employees who worked for openAI had very focused beliefs on two things: 1 - the more you pour more computing into the models, they'll get better and better with no end in sight; and 2 - in addition to scaling the models up, you needed alignment or safety. So, a group of employees who trusted each other and who shared the same mindset with a focused research bet of training models with safety and alignment with human values at the center of AI left OpenAI to work together in a new company - Anthropic PBC. (Anthropic’s CEO Says Why He Quit His Job at OpenAI to Start a Competitor That Just Received Billions From Amazon and Google, 2023)

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Because Anthropic, PBC is a privately held company, they do not have public stock offerings. However, Anthropic has raised significant capital through several rounds of funding since their recent inception in 2021. Just a few months into incorporation, Anthropic, PBC had raised $124 million dollars to kickstart their vision to create more reliable, general AI systems. (“Anthropic raises $124 million to build more reliable, general AI systems
May 28, 2021●1 min read") (Anthropic Raises $124 Million to Build More Reliable, General AI. . ., 2023).
Most recently,
>"Starting work on our own neural network required increased funding. Anthropic's creators needed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase the ultra-powerful processors needed to train AI models. One of the startup's first investors was Google's cloud division, which invested $300 million in it for a 10% stake in the project. In addition, the terms of the deal obligated the young company to use Google Cloud computing resources for its work.
>
>At the end of 2022, Anthropic received funding totaling $700 million. Of this, $500 million was invested by Alameda Research, a subsidiary of the famous cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which later went bankrupt. The founder and head of the exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried, was personally present on the list of investors at the Series B stage. It is worth noting that Anthropic is associated with the now-popular “effective altruism” movement, which Bankman-Fried and other famous entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley spoke positively about. Apparently, this, in particular, was the reason for the favor towards the startup.
>
>Funding for the development of the innovative neural network Anthropic AI Claude continued in 2023. In May, the startup raised $450 million in another round of investment, which included Spark Capital, Menlo Ventures and Sound Ventures. The communications platform Zoom and the investment arm of Salesforce also invested in it. In September 2023, Amazon announced plans to sponsor Anthropic, PBC for a huge amount of $4 billion (the first tranche will be $1.25 billion). The deal will see Amazon Web Services (AWS) become the startup's primary cloud computing provider. In addition, Amazon will receive a minority stake in the enterprise."
(Andreev, 2023)

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

According to Anthropic, PBC's website, the problem they are trying to solve is to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. They are doing this with a team approach that includes researchers, engineers, policy experts and operational leaders from a variety of disciplines all collaborating toward the same mission.
(Pbc, 2023). 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Anthropic, PBC's intended customer is anyone using AI - individuals and society. There is no defined market size to account for everybody. Suffice it to say, that the market size of this group of customers is very large, perhaps without limits.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The solution that Anthropic, PBC offers that its competitors do not or cannot offer is the core of their mission:
>"to ensure transformative AI helps people and society flourish." 
(Pbc, 2023)
Although Anthropic, PBC's competitors may market themselves to be similar-minded,   
>"Anthropic sets itself apart from OpenAI and other AI companies through its commitments to research and safety. By researching why AI makes the decisions that it does, Anthropic aims to gear AI towards outcomes which are beneficial to society as a whole." (Cerebral Valley : A Brief History of Anthropic (and Claude), n.d.) accessed on October 30, 2023

Perhaps one of the main advantages that Anthropic, PBC utilizes isn't just the technologies themselves as listed above, but in the fact that Anthropic PBC's founders were predominant leaders in the AI industry who crafted the latest AI technologies in use today. So, Anthropic, PBC is building upon what they have already created giving them a deep and intimate understanding of the current technologies.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Anthropic, PBC utilizes a wide array of technologies in pursuit of its ambitious goals. Most recently and notably, 
>“Anthropic selects AWS as its primary cloud provider and will train and deploy its future foundation models on AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, taking advantage of AWS’s high-performance, low-cost machine learning accelerators” (Amazon and Anthropic Announce Strategic Collaboration to Advance Generative AI, 2023)
Additionally, Anthropic PBC institutes cybersecurity best practices. Specifically, 
>Anthropic is implementing two-party controls, SSDF, SLSA, and other cybersecurity best practices. As model capabilities scale, we will need to further enhance security protections, moving beyond the above recommendations. This will necessarily be an iterative process in consultation with government and industry.
(Frontier Model Security, 2023)

Two-party controls require two keys to open the most secure vaults. SSDF (Secure Software Development Framework) is a set of development practices that helps to limit vulnerabilities in software. SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts) is a sort of checklist of standards to follow during software development to help build a secure software environment that can reduce malicious intrusions thereby protecting the software system. 

Collectively, the above technologies should offer the space to operate such a large agenda with ample cloud services and the most powerful computing capabilities coupled with a safety system of proper checks and balances. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

Anthropic, PBC operates in the AI field of safety and research. Safety and research can be broadly applied within any subfield within AI, such as medicine, finance, business, etc. However, saftey and research are paramount to all AI fields.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

For a quick snapshot of notable AI history, see the following image:
![The brief history of artificial intelligence_ The world has changed fast – what might be next_ - Our World in Data](https://images.prismic.io/contrary-research/be106f0d-c22c-4ebf-9922-7eb33d94a066_1.png?auto=compress,format) (Roser, 2023)

As recently as a year ago, it seemed as though open-source efforts were leading the charge in AI development, but in 2023 Big Tech has reasserted its position on its hold on the safety sector.  The open-source realm practices to freely share their up-to-date research efforts, but now that apparently has come to an end. Now with Big Tech seemingly in the lead, opacity appears to be the company culture. (Perrigo, 2023)


* What are the other major companies in this field?

Anthropic PBC is a very small, albeit rapidly growing company. However, they are working among some major league hitters in the industry. Some major companies include Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple. Some smaller rivals include Cohere, Alphabet's DeepMind,, and AI21 Labs. There is also some vertical companies in the mix who are AI providers focused on specific tasks like self-driving cars such as (Waymo, Cruise) or AI assistants (Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri) (Anthropic Competitive Analysis 2023 &#8211; Business Analysis, 2023)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
In Anthropic, PBC's short existence to date they have made their mark as an industry leader. 
>“It’s not for nothing that the Anthropic startup is called one of the most promising IT projects of our time. It was founded by a small group of enthusiasts and, to this day, is far from the scale of large corporations. However, the company's mission of not only developing artificial intelligence technologies, but also giving them humanity, is critical. The chatbot it created, Claude Anthropic AI, is only the first, essentially a trial product, and does not yet have any superpowers. But the foundations Anthropic is laying for humane and safe AI could have a tremendous impact on the entire artificial intelligence industry, pointing the way for larger-scale developments in the future.”
(Andreev, 2023)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

With Anthropic, PBC being a private company, research efforts were limiting in certain types of information. Determining specific company metrics was not revealed in the sources used. However, among the various research performed, the following metrics appear to be mentioned or inferred in general throughout the various sources: Profitability, sizes of investors/investments, number of clients and end users, and overall user appeal to trust this brand. Profitability information was not readily available with the public research evaluated. Given the available data on Anthropic PBC's funding, most particularly the latest of Amazon's plan to induce 4 billion dollars to the campaign, it appears that the company is capturing the interest and capital from very large corporations with very large dollar commitments. Google and some other big name corporations have also contributed to their earlier findung rounds. Since the company is private, the number of clients is not known. But seeing the big-name investors involved, it can be surmised that the number of clients and end users alike will be a very large segment of the AI user audience. Only time will tell though on whether Anthropic, PBC will be a household trusty brand in the field of AI safety. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

Judging by some of the Big Tech investors and the increasing tranche of funds, it appears that Anthropic, PBC is doing quite well for itself which is an indication that they may be advancing better than their competition. And knowing that Anthropic, PBC has only been around since 2021, they are certainly becoming very well recognized as an industry leader as one of the top growing firms in this field. A quick take on the specifics that set them apart from their competition, 
>“What are the strengths and weaknesses of Anthropic versus its key competitors?
>Strengths
>•	Cutting-edge conversational AI using techniques like Constitutional AI and hybrid training
>•	Strong technical team with AI experts like Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei
>•	Backing by top VCs like DCVC and Founders Fund
>•	Focus on AI safety, ethics, and transparency
>Weaknesses
>•	Smaller scale and resources versus giants like Google and Meta
>•	Less brand recognition with consumers than Alexa or Siri
>•	Narrower product focus than horizontally integrated rivals
>•	Still building out go-to-market and sales capabilities“
(Anthropic Competitive Analysis 2023 &#8211; Business Analysis, 2023)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

As Anthropic, PBC continues to build their products and services to accomplish their goals for AI safety, it is suggested that they develop a tool or service that could showcase the fallacies built within products of their competitors. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
No matter how safe a company says that their product is, it must be trusted by those who use it. Else, Anthropic, PBC's products could just be one tool of many that users will need to compare for themselves to deem who is the most trustworthy for their use and reliance. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Fortunately, most of the technologies that Anthropic, PBC utilizes could be used to offer this additional recommended product or service. The key and underlying problem is the availability of the data to process. Competitors will obviously not want to openly share their full data sets. However, new technologies may emerge to provide the capability of reverse-engineering the competitors products in a back-door way of extracting the data without ever having direct access to it. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

If the current and future technologies can, in fact,  reverse-engineer your competitors' tools, what better way is there to prove to "the common good" that your product is safe by not only showing the results of your products and services that they are safe but also showing why the competitors' is not safe or are deceivingly safe. This is akin to a side-by-side or apples-to-apples comparison.
